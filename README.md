<h1> Create and Manage a SAS Key</h1>
<br>

In this exercise, you will generate a shared access signature (SAS) key and an access policy.

1. First, you will create a storage account and a container, and then you will upload a blob file to the container.

2. Next, you will generate a SAS key, and then you will test the key for access.

3. Finally, you will generate an access policy, and then you will test access and revocation.

<br>


Azure provides storage accounts for storing data in the cloud as blobs, files, queues, and tables. You can grant access to data by using SAS keys and access policies.
<br>
